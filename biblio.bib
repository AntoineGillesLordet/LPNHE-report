	abstract = {Accurate analyses of present and next-generation cosmological galaxy surveys require new ways to handle effects of non-linear gravitational structure formation processes in data. To address these needs we present an extension of our previously developed algorithm for Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) to analyse matter clustering at non-linear scales in observations. This is achieved by incorporating a numerical particle mesh model of gravitational structure formation into our Bayesian inference framework. The algorithm simultaneously infers the three-dimensional primordial matter fluctuations from which present non-linear observations formed and provides reconstructions of velocity fields and structure formation histories. The physical forward modelling approach automatically accounts for the non-Gaussian features in gravitationally evolved matter density fields and addresses the redshift space distortion problem associated with peculiar motions of observed galaxies. Our algorithm employs a hierarchical Bayes approach to jointly account for various observational effects, such as unknown galaxy biases, selection effects, and observational noise. Corresponding parameters of the data model are marginalized out via a sophisticated Markov chain Monte Carlo approach relying on a combination of a multiple block sampling framework and an efficient implementation of a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler. We demonstrate the performance of the method by applying it to the 2M++ galaxy compilation, tracing the matter distribution of the nearby universe. We show accurate and detailed inferences of the three-dimensional non-linear dark matter distribution of the nearby universe. As exemplified in the case of the Coma cluster, our method provides complementary mass estimates that are compatible with those obtained from weak lensing and X-ray observations. For the first time, we also present a reconstruction of the vorticity of the non-linear velocity field from observations. In summary, our method provides plausible and very detailed inferences of the dark matter and velocity fields of our cosmic neighbourhood.},

We introduce cuts on survey coverage, sky visibility around peak light, and other properties unconnected to the nature of the transient, and show that the resulting statistical sample is spectroscopically 97\% complete at {\textless}18 mag, 93\% complete at {\textless}18.5 mag, and 75\% complete at {\textless}19 mag. We summarize the fundamental properties of this population, identifying distinct duration-luminosity correlations in a variety of supernova (SN) classes and associating the majority of fast optical transients with well-established spectroscopic SN types (primarily SN Ibn and II/IIb). We measure the Type Ia SN and core-collapse (CC) SN rates and luminosity functions, which show good consistency with recent work. About 7\% of CC SNe explode in very low-luminosity galaxies (M\_i {\textgreater} -16 mag), 10\% in red-sequence galaxies, and 1\% in massive ellipticals. We find no significant difference in the luminosity or color distributions between the host galaxies of Type II and Type Ib/c supernovae, suggesting that line-driven wind stripping does not play a major role in the loss of the hydrogen envelope from their progenitors. Future large-scale classification efforts with ZTF and other wide-area surveys will provide high-quality measurements of the rates, properties, and environments of all known types of optical transients and limits on the existence of theoretically predicted but as of yet unobserved explosions.},

We simulated the equivalent of 6 years of ZTF data, and considering an unbiased spectroscopically typed sample at z {\textless} 0.06, we obtained unbiased estimates of f σ8 with an average uncertainty of 19\% precision.

	abstract = {Over the next five years, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) will use 10 spectrographs with 5000 fibers on the 4m Mayall Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory to conduct the first Stage-IV dark energy galaxy survey. At \$z {\textless} 0.6\$, the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) will produce the most detailed map of the Universe during the dark energy dominated epoch with redshifts of {\textgreater}10 million galaxies over 14,000 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$. In this work, we present and validate the final BGS target selection and survey design. From the Legacy Surveys, BGS will target a \$r {\textless} 19.5\$ magnitude-limited sample (BGS Bright); a fainter \$19.5 {\textless} r {\textless} 20.175\$ sample, color-selected to have high redshift efficiency (BGS Faint); and a smaller low-z quasar sample. BGS will observe these targets using exposure times, scaled to achieve uniform completeness, and visit each point on the footprint three times. We use observations from the Survey Validation programs conducted prior to the main survey along with realistic simulations to show that BGS can complete its strategy and make optimal use of `bright' time. We demonstrate that BGS targets have stellar contamination {\textless}1\% and that their densities do not depend strongly on imaging properties. We also confirm that BGS Bright will achieve {\textgreater}80\% fiber assignment efficiency. Finally, we show that BGS Bright and Faint will achieve {\textgreater}95\% redshift success rates with no significant dependence on observing conditions. BGS meets the requirements for an extensive range of scientific applications. BGS will yield the most precise Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Redshift-Space Distortions measurements at \$z {\textless} 0.4\$. It also presents opportunities to exploit new methods that require highly complete and dense galaxy samples (e.g. N-point statistics, multi-tracers). BGS further provides a powerful tool to study galaxy populations and the relations between galaxies and dark matter.},

This 8 (Gpc/h){\textasciicircum}3 N-body simulation comprises 2.1 trillion particles and provides high-resolution dark matter (sub)haloes in the framework of the Planck base-LCDM cosmology. Employing the subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) technique, we populate the Uchuu (sub)haloes with all four DESI tracers (BGS, LRG, ELG and QSO) to z = 2.1. Our method accounts for redshift evolution as well as the clustering dependence on luminosity and stellar mass. The two-point clustering statistics of the DESI One-Percent Survey align reasonably well with our predictions from Uchuu across scales ranging from 0.1 Mpc/h to 100 Mpc/h. Some discrepancies arise due to cosmic variance, incompleteness in the massive end of the stellar mass function, and a simplified galaxy-halo connection model. We find that the Uchuu BGS and LRG samples are adequately described using the standard 5-parameter halo occupation distribution model, while the ELGs and QSOs show agreement with an adopted Gaussian distribution for central halos with a power law for satellites. We observe a fair agreement in the large-scale bias measurements between data and mock samples, although the data exhibits smaller bias values, likely due to cosmic variance. The bias dependence on absolute magnitude, stellar mass and redshift aligns with that of previous surveys. These results improve simulated lightcone construction from cosmological models and enhance our understanding of the galaxy-halo connection, with pivotal insights from the first DESI data for the success of the final survey.},

Our analysis -- which takes special care to properly weight each DSS subcatalogue and cross-calibrate the relative distance scales between them -- results in a measurement of the cosmological parameter combination \$f{\textbackslash}sigma\_8 = 0.390\_\{-0.022\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.022\}\$ as well as an external bulk flow velocity of \$195\_\{-23\}{\textasciicircum}\{+22\}\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ in the direction \$({\textbackslash}ell, b) = (292\_\{-7\}{\textasciicircum}\{+7\}, -6\_\{-4\}{\textasciicircum}\{+5\})\$ deg, which originates from beyond the 2M++ reconstruction.

Our constraint on \$f{\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$ -- the tightest derived from SNe to date (considering only statistical error bars), and the only one to utilise SNe II -- is broadly consistent with other results from the literature.

In this work, we have compiled a new sample of 465 peculiar velocities from low redshift \$(z {\textless} 0.067)\$ Type Ia supernovae. We compare the reconstructed velocity field derived from the 2M++ galaxy redshift compilation to the supernovae, the SFI++ and the 2MTF Tully-Fisher distance catalogues. We used a forward method to jointly infer the distances and the velocities of distance indicators by comparing the observations to the reconstruction. Comparison of the reconstructed peculiar velocity fields to observations allows us to infer the cosmological parameter combination \$f{\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$, and the bulk flow velocity arising from outside the survey volume. The residual bulk flow arising from outside the 2M++ volume is inferred to be \$171{\textasciicircum}\{+11\}\_\{-11\}\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ in the direction \$l=301{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\} {\textbackslash}pm 4{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ and \$b=0{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\} {\textbackslash}pm 3{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$.

Here we constrain the growth rate of the structure by comparing observed Fundamental Plane peculiar velocities for 15 894 galaxies from the 6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with predicted velocities and densities from the 2M++ redshift survey. We measure the velocity scale parameter \${\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}equiv \{{\textbackslash}Omega \_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}gamma \}/b = 0.372{\textasciicircum}\{+0.034\}\_\{-0.050\}\$ and \$0.314{\textasciicircum}\{+0.031\}\_\{-0.047\}\$ for 6dFGS and SDSS, respectively, where Ωm is the mass density parameter, γ is the growth index, and b is the bias parameter normalized to the characteristic luminosity of galaxies, L*. Combining 6dFGS and SDSS, we obtain β = 0.341 ± 0.024, implying that the amplitude of the product of the growth rate and the mass fluctuation amplitude is fσ8 = 0.338 ± 0.027 at an effective redshift z = 0.035. Adopting Ωm = 0.315 ± 0.007, as favoured by Planck and using γ = 6/11 for General Relativity and γ = 11/16 for DGP gravity, we get \$S\_8(z=0) = {\textbackslash}sigma \_8 {\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}Omega \_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\}/0.3\} =0.637 {\textbackslash}pm 0.054\$ and 0.741 ± 0.062 for GR and DGP, respectively. This measurement agrees with other low-redshift probes of large-scale structure but deviates by more than 3σ from the latest Planck CMB measurement. Our results favour values of the growth index γ {\textgreater} 6/11 or a Hubble constant H0 {\textgreater} 70 km s-1 Mpc-1 or a fluctuation amplitude σ8 {\textless} 0.8 or some combination of these. Imminent redshift surveys such as Taipan, DESI, WALLABY, and SKA1-MID will help to resolve this tension by measuring the growth rate of cosmic structure to 1 per cent in the redshift range 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.},

In this work, we present a method for extracting the information contained within galaxy peculiar velocities through an ensemble of direct peculiar velocity and galaxy clustering correlation statistics, including the effects of redshift space distortions, using data from the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey. Our method compares the auto- and cross-correlation function multipoles of these observables, with respect to the local line of sight, with the predictions of cosmological models. We find that the uncertainty in our measurement is improved when combining these two sources of information in comparison to fitting to either peculiar velocity or clustering information separately. When combining velocity and density statistics in the range \$27 s 123 {\textbackslash}, h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ Mpc we obtain a value for the local growth rate of fσ8 = 0.358 ± 0.075 and for the linear redshift distortion parameter β = 0.298 ± 0.065, recovering both with 20.9 per cent and 21.8 per cent accuracy, respectively. We conclude this work by comparing our measurement with other recent local measurements of the growth rate, spanning different data sets and methodologies. We find that our results are in broad agreement with those in the literature and are fully consistent with ΛCDM cosmology.

In this work, we provide new constraints on \$f{\textbackslash}sigma\_\{8\}\$ at an effective redshift of \$z=0.03\$ using the combined density and velocity fields measured by the 2MTF and 6dFGSv surveys. We do this by applying a new estimator of the redshift-space density and momentum (density-weighted velocity) power spectra, developed in the first paper of this series, to measured redshifts and peculiar velocities from these datasets. We combine this with models of the density and momentum power spectra in the presence of complex survey geometries and with an ensemble of simulated galaxy catalogues that match the survey selection functions and galaxy bias. We use these simulations to estimate the errors on our measurements and identify possible systematics. In particular, we are able to identify and remove biases caused by the non-Gaussianity of the power spectra by applying the Box-Cox transformation to the power spectra prior to fitting. After thorough validation of our methods we recover a constraint of \$f{\textbackslash}sigma\_8(z\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eff\}\}=0.03)=0.404{\textasciicircum}\{+0.082\}\_\{-0.081\}\$ from the combined 2MTF and 6dFGSv data.

We find no evidence for a scale-dependence in the growth rate, or any statistically significant variation from the growth rate as predicted by the Planck cosmology.

We pay particular attention to systematic errors. We point out that the intrinsic scatter present in Fundamental Plane and Tully-Fisher relations is only Gaussian in logarithmic distance units; wrongly assuming it is Gaussian in linear (velocity) units can bias cosmological constraints. We also analytically marginalize over zero-point errors in distance indicators, validate the accuracy of all our constraints using numerical simulations, and demonstrate how to combine different (correlated) velocity surveys using a matrix `hyperparameter' analysis.

	abstract = {We present measurements of the velocity power spectrum and constraints on the growth rate of structure fσ8, at redshift zero, using the peculiar motions of 2062 galaxies in the completed 2MASS Tully-Fisher survey (2MTF). To accomplish this we introduce a model for fitting the velocity power spectrum including the effects of non-linear redshift space distortions (RSD), allowing us to recover unbiased fits down to scales k = 0.2 h Mpc-1 without the need to smooth or grid the data. Our fitting methods are validated using a set of simulated 2MTF surveys. Using these simulations we also identify that the Gaussian distributed estimator for peculiar velocities of Watkins \& Feldman is suitable for measuring the velocity power spectrum, but sub-optimal for the 2MTF data compared to using magnitude fluctuations δm, and that, whilst our fits are robust to a change in fiducial cosmology, future peculiar velocity surveys with more constraining power may have to marginalize over this. We obtain scale-dependent constraints on the growth rate of structure in two bins, finding fσ 8 = [0.55{\textasciicircum}\{+0.16\}\_\{-0.13\},0.40{\textasciicircum}\{+0.16\}\_\{-0.17\}] in the ranges k = [0.007-0.055, 0.55-0.150] h Mpc-1. We also find consistent results using four bins. Assuming scale-independence we find a value fσ 8 = 0.51{\textasciicircum}\{+0.09\}\_\{-0.08\}, a ∼16 per cent measurement of the growth rate. Performing a consistency check of general relativity (GR) and combining our results with cosmic microwave background data only we find γ = 0.45{\textasciicircum}\{+0.10\}\_\{-0.11\}, a remarkable constraint considering the small number of galaxies. All of our results are completely independent of the effects of galaxy bias, and fully consistent with the predictions of GR (scale-independent fσ8 and γ ≈ 0.55).},

The galaxy overdensity and peculiar velocity fields help us to constrain the growth rate of structure and distinguish different models of gravity. We introduce an improved method for constraining the growth rate of structure with the galaxy overdensity and peculiar velocity fields. This method reduces the modelling systematic error by accounting for the wide-angle effect and the zero-point calibration uncertainty during the modelling process. We also speed up the posterior sampling by around 30 times by first calculating the likelihood at a small number of fiducial points and then interpolating the likelihood values during MCMC sampling. We test the new method on mocks and we find it is able to recover the fiducial growth rate of structure. We applied our new method to the SDSS PV catalogue, which is the largest single peculiar velocity catalogue to date. Our constraint on the growth rate of structure is {\textbackslash}(f{\textbackslash}sigma\_8 = 0.405\_\{-0.071\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.076\}{\textbackslash}) (stat) {\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}pm 0.009{\textbackslash}) (sys) at the effective redshift of 0.073.

	abstract = {Peculiar velocities of objects in the nearby universe are correlated due to the gravitational pull of large-scale structure. By measuring these velocities, we have a unique opportunity to test the cosmological model at the lowest redshifts. We perform this test, using current data to constrain the amplitude of the "signal" covariance matrix describing the velocities and their correlations. We consider a new, well-calibrated "Supercal" set of low-redshift SNe Ia as well as a set of distances derived from the fundamental plane relation of 6dFGS galaxies. Analyzing the SN and galaxy data separately, both results are consistent with the peculiar velocity signal of our fiducial \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model, ruling out the noise-only model with zero peculiar velocities at greater than \$7{\textbackslash}sigma\$ (SNe) and \$8{\textbackslash}sigma\$ (galaxies). When the two data sets are combined appropriately, the precision of the test increases slightly, resulting in a constraint on the signal amplitude of \$A = 1.05\_\{-0.21\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.25\}\$, where \$A = 1\$ corresponds to our fiducial model. Equivalently, we report an 11\% measurement of the product of the growth rate and amplitude of mass fluctuations evaluated at \$z\_{\textbackslash}text\{eff\} = 0.02\$, \$f {\textbackslash}sigma\_8 = 0.428\_\{-0.045\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.048\}\$, valid for our fiducial \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model. We explore the robustness of the results to a number of conceivable variations in the analysis and find that individual variations shift the preferred signal amplitude by less than \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}0.5{\textbackslash}sigma\$. We briefly discuss our Supercal SN Ia results in comparison with our previous results using the JLA compilation.},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of peculiar velocities and their effect on supernova cosmology. In particular, we study (a) the corrections due to our own motion, (b) the effects of correlations in peculiar velocities induced by large-scale structure, and (c) uncertainties arising from a possible local under- or over-density. For all of these effects we present a case study of their impact on the cosmology derived by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II Supernova Survey (SDSS-II SN Survey). Correcting supernova redshifts for the CMB dipole slightly over-corrects nearby supernovae that share some of our local motion. We show that while neglecting the CMB dipole would cause a shift in the derived equation of state of Delta w {\textasciitilde} 0.04 (at fixed matter density) the additional local-motion correction is currently negligible (Delta w{\textless}0.01). We use a covariance-matrix approach to statistically account for correlated peculiar velocities. This down-weights nearby supernovae and effectively acts as a graduated version of the usual sharp low-redshift cut. Neglecting coherent velocities in the current sample causes a systematic shift of {\textasciitilde}2\% in the preferred value of w and will therefore have to be considered carefully when future surveys aim for percent-level accuracy. Finally, we perform n-body simulations to estimate the likely magnitude of any local density fluctuation (monopole) and estimate the impact as a function of the low-redshift cutoff. We see that for this aspect the low-z cutoff of z=0.02 is well-justified theoretically, but that living in a putative local density fluctuation leaves an indelible imprint on the magnitude-redshift relation.},

The K-band selected subsample which we employ in this study contains 81 971 galaxies distributed over 17 000 degree2 with an effective redshift zeff= 0.067. By modelling the 2D galaxy correlation function, ?, we measure the parameter combination f(zeff)σ8(zeff) = 0.423 ± 0.055, where ? is the growth rate of cosmic structure and σ8 is the rms of matter fluctuations in 8 h-1 Mpc spheres. Alternatively, by assuming standard gravity we can break the degeneracy between σ8 and the galaxy bias parameter b. Combining our data with the Hubble constant prior from Riess et al., we measure σ8= 0.76 ± 0.11 and Ωm= 0.250 ± 0.022, consistent with constraints from other galaxy surveys and the cosmic microwave background data from Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7 (WMAP7). Combining our measurement of fσ8 with WMAP7 allows us to test the cosmic growth history and the relationship between matter and gravity on cosmic scales by constraining the growth index of density fluctuations, γ. Using only 6dFGS and WMAP7 data we find γ= 0.547 ± 0.088, consistent with the prediction of General Relativity. We note that because of the low effective redshift of the 6dFGS our measurement of the growth rate is independent of the fiducial cosmological model (Alcock-Paczynski effect). We also show that our conclusions are not sensitive to the model adopted for non-linear redshift-space distortions. Using a Fisher matrix analysis we report predictions for constraints on fσ8 for the Wide-field Australian SKA Pathfinder telescope L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) and the proposed Transforming Astronomical Imaging surveys through Polychromatic Analysis of Nebulae (TAIPAN) survey. The WALLABY survey will be able to measure fσ8 with a precision of 4-10 per cent, depending on the modelling of non-linear structure formation. This is comparable to the predicted precision for the best redshift bins of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, demonstrating that low-redshift surveys have a significant role to play in future tests of dark energy and modified gravity.},

Our sample, which we denote MGS, covers 6,813 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ with an effective redshift \$z\_\{eff\}=0.15\$ and is described in our companion paper (Paper I), which concentrates on BAO measurements. In order to validate the fitting methods used in both papers, and derive errors, we create and analyse 1000 mock catalogues using a new algorithm called PICOLA to generate accurate dark matter fields. Haloes are then selected using a friends-of-friends algorithm, and populated with galaxies using a Halo-Occupation Distribution fitted to the data. Using errors derived from these mocks, we fit a model to the monopole and quadrupole moments of the MGS correlation function. If we assume no Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect (valid at \$z=0.15\$ for any smooth model of the expansion history), we measure the amplitude of the velocity field, \$f{\textbackslash}sigma\_\{8\}\$, at \$z=0.15\$ to be \$0.49\_\{-0.14\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.15\}\$. We also measure \$f{\textbackslash}sigma\_\{8\}\$ including the AP effect. This latter measurement can be freely combined with recent Cosmic Microwave Background results to constrain the growth index of fluctuations, \${\textbackslash}gamma\$. Assuming a background \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology and combining with current Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data we find \${\textbackslash}gamma = 0.64 {\textbackslash}pm 0.09\$, which is consistent with the prediction of General Relativity (\${\textbackslash}gamma {\textbackslash}approx 0.55\$), though with a slight preference for higher \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ and hence models with weaker gravitational interactions.},

The survey, which uses the Subaru Telescope and covers a redshift range of 1.19 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.55, is the first cosmological study at such high redshifts. We detect clear anisotropy due to redshift-space distortions (RSD) both in the correlation function as a function of separations parallel and perpendicular to the line of sight and its quadrupole moment. RSD has been extensively used to test general relativity on cosmological scales at z {\textless} 1. Adopting a ΛCDM cosmology with the fixed expansion history and no velocity dispersion (σv = 0), and using the RSD measurements on scales above 8 h-1 Mpc, we obtain the first constraint on the growth rate at the redshift, f (z)σ8(z) = 0.482 ± 0.116 at z ∼ 1.4 after marginalizing over the galaxy bias parameter b(z)σ8(z). This corresponds to 4.2 σ detection of RSD. Our constraint is consistent with the prediction of general relativity fσ8 ∼ 0.392 within the 1 σ confidence level. When we allow σv to vary and marginalize over it, the growth rate constraint becomes fσ \_8=0.494{\textasciicircum}\{+0.126\}\_\{-0.120\}. We also demonstrate that by combining with the low-z constraints on fσ8, high-z galaxy surveys like the FastSound can be useful to distinguish modified gravity models without relying on CMB anisotropy experiments.},

	abstract = {The global properties of elliptical galaxies, such as luminosity, radius, projected velocity dispersion, projected luminosity, etc., form a two-dimensional family. This 'fundamental plane' of elliptical galaxies can be defined in observable terms by the velocity dispersion and mean surface brightness. Its thickness is given by the present measurement error bars, and there are no significant indications of nonlinearity or higher dimensionality. This is indicative of a strong regularity in the process of galaxy formation. The equations of the plane can be used as new, substantially improved distance indicators for elliptical galaxies. However, all morphological parameters which describe the shape of the light distribution (ellipticity, elippticity gradient, isophotal twist rate, slope of the surface brightness profile) and reflect dynamical anisotropies of stars are completely independent of this fundamental plane. Thus, the elliptical galaxies are actually a '2 + N' parameter family. The M/L ratios correlate only with the velocity dispersions and show a small intrinsic scatter, perhaps only about 30 percent, in a luminosity range spanning some four orders of magnitude; this suggests a constant fraction of the dark matter contribution in elliptical galaxies.},

Our method consistently accounts for the inhomogeneous Malmquist (IHM) bias using analytical integration along the line of sight. By testing our method on a simulation, we show that our method gives an unbiased reconstruction of the velocity field. We show that not accounting for the IHM bias can lead to significant biases in the Bayesian reconstructions. We applied our method to a peculiar velocity data set consisting of the SFI++ and 2MTF Tully-Fisher catalogues and the A2 supernovae compilation, thus obtaining a novel velocity reconstruction in the local Universe. Our velocity reconstructions have a cosmological power spectrum consistent with the theoretical expectation. Furthermore, we obtain a full description of the uncertainties on reconstruction through samples of the posterior distribution. We validate our velocity reconstruction of the local Universe by comparing it to an independent reconstruction using the 2M++ galaxy catalogue, obtaining good agreement between the two reconstructions. Using Bayesian model comparison, we find that our velocity model performs better than the adaptive kernel smoothed velocity with the same peculiar velocity data. However, our velocity model does not perform as well as the velocity reconstruction from the 2M++ galaxy catalogue, due to the sparse and noisy nature of the peculiar velocity tracer samples. The method presented here provides a way to include peculiar velocity data in initial condition reconstruction frameworks.},

We implement this field-based physical inference approach by adapting the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (\${\textbackslash}small \{{\textbackslash}rm BORG\}\$) algorithm, which explores the high-dimensional posterior through the use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. We test the self-consistency of the method using random sets of tracers, and assess its accuracy in a more complex scenario where peculiar velocity tracers are mock haloes drawn from \${\textbackslash}small \{{\textbackslash}rm GADGET2\}\$ N-body simulations. We find that our framework self-consistently infers the initial conditions, density and velocity fields, and shows some robustness to model mis-specification. Compared with the approach of constrained Gaussian random fields/Wiener filtering, the hierarchical model produces more accurate final density and velocity field reconstructions. It also allows us to constrain the initial conditions by peculiar velocity observations, complementing in this aspect other field-based approaches based on alternative cosmological observables such as galaxy clustering or weak lensing.},

	abstract = {Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) cosmology relies on the estimation of lightcurve parameters to derive precision distances that leads to the estimation of cosmological parameters. The empirical SALT2 lightcurve modeling that relies on only two parameters, a stretch x1, and a color c, has been used by the community for almost two decades. In this paper we study the ability of the SALT2 model to fit the nearly 3000 cosmology-grade SN Ia lightcurves from the second release of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) cosmology science working group. While the ZTF data was not used to train SALT2, the algorithm is modeling the ZTF SN Ia optical lightcurves remarkably well, except for lightcurve points prior to -10 d from maximum, where the training critically lacks statistics. We find that the lightcurve fitting is robust against the considered choice of phase-range, but we show the [-10; +40] d range to be optimal in terms of statistics and accuracy. We do not detect any significant features in the lightcurve fit residuals that could be connected to the host environment. Potential systematic population differences related to the SN Ia host properties might thus not be accountable for by the addition of extra lightcurve parameters. However, a small but significant inconsistency between residuals of blue- and red-SN Ia strongly suggests the existence of a phase-dependent color term, with potential implications for the use of SNe Ia in precision cosmology. We thus encourage modellers to explore this avenue and we emphasize the importance that SN Ia cosmology must include a SALT2 retraining to accurately model the lightcurves and avoid biasing the derivation of cosmological parameters.},

	abstract = {The detailed nature of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) remains uncertain, and as survey statistics increase, the question of astrophysical systematic uncertainties arises, notably that of the evolution of SN Ia populations. We study the dependence on redshift of the SN Ia {\textless}i{\textgreater}SALT2.4{\textless}i/{\textgreater} light-curve stretch, which is a purely intrinsic SN property, to probe its potential redshift drift. The SN stretch has been shown to be strongly correlated with the SN environment, notably with stellar age tracers. We modeled the underlying stretch distribution as a function of redshift, using the evolution of the fraction of young and old SNe Ia as predicted using the SNfactory dataset, and assuming a constant underlying stretch distribution for each age population consisting of Gaussian mixtures. We tested our prediction against published samples that were cut to have marginal magnitude selection effects, so that any observed change is indeed astrophysical and not observational in origin. In this first study, there are indications that the underlying SN Ia stretch distribution evolves as a function of redshift, and that the age drifting model is a better description of the data than any time-constant model, including the sample-based asymmetric distributions that are often used to correct Malmquist bias at a significance higher than 5{\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. The favored underlying stretch model is a bimodal one, composed of a high-stretch mode shared by both young and old environments, and a low-stretch mode that is exclusive to old environments. The precise effect of the redshift evolution of the intrinsic properties of a SN Ia population on cosmology remains to be studied. The astrophysical drift of the SN stretch distribution does affect current Malmquist bias corrections, however, and thereby the distances that are derived based on SN that are affected by observational selection effects. We highlight that this bias will increase with surveys covering increasingly larger redshift ranges, which is particularly important for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.},

	abstract = {As Type Ia supernova cosmology transitions from a statistics dominated to a systematics dominated era, it is crucial to understand leftover unexplained uncertainties affecting their luminosity, such as the ones stemming from astrophysical biases. Indeed, SNe Ia are standardisable candles, whose absolute magnitude reach a 0.15{\textasciitilde}mag scatter once empirical correlations with their lightcurve stretch and colour and with their environment are accounted for. In this paper, we investigate how the standardisation process of SNe Ia depends on environment, to ultimately reduce their scatter in magnitude, focusing on colour standardisation. We use the volume-limited ZTF SN Ia DR2 sample, which offers unprecedented statistics for the low redshift (\$z{\textless}0.06\$) range. We first study the colour distribution, focusing on the effects of dust, to then select a dustless subsample of objects from low stellar mass environments and from the outskirts of their host galaxies. We then look at the colour-residuals relation and its associated parameter \${\textbackslash}beta\$. Finally, we investigate the colour dependency of the environment-dependent magnitude offsets (steps), to try to disentangle intrinsic and extrinsic colour origin. Our sample probes well the red tail of the colour distribution, up to \$c=0.8\$. The dustless sample exhibits a significantly lower red tail (\$4.6{\textbackslash}sigma\$) in comparison to the whole sample. This suggests that reddening above \$c{\textbackslash}geq0.2\$ is dominated by host interstellar dust absorption. Looking at the colour-residuals relation, we find it to be linear with lightcurve colour. We show hints of a potential evolution of \${\textbackslash}beta\$ with host stellar mass at a \$2.5{\textbackslash}sigma\$ level. Finally, unlike recent claims from the literature, we see no evolution of steps as a function of lightcurve colour, suggesting that dust may not be the dominating mechanism responsible for the environmental dependency of SNe Ia magnitude.},

	abstract = {If, in addition to the usual luminosity correction described by the light curve slope parameter b, we introduce a color correction parameter R, then an extraordinarily good fit is realized for all the 29 distant Type Ia supernovae of the recent Calacutea n/Tololo supernova survey. The reduced chi (2) found is much lower than can be expected. All of the intrinsic dispersion is thereby removed from the data sample, leaving perfectly standardized candles insofar as one can measure with present techniques. The best-fit solution has a mysteriously low value for R (referred to the B-band) of about 2 and a value of b {\textasciitilde} 0.5 which is smaller than previously reported without the color correction. These parameters lead, using pre-Hipparcos distances for Cepheid calibrations, to essentially the same value for the Hubble constant. Our preliminary value, subject to further investigation of Cepheid-calibrated supernovae using this same color correction, is H\{0 = 60 +/- 6 {\textbackslash} kms(-1) Mpc(-1\}) .

	abstract = {Type Ia supernovae provide direct evidence for an accelerating universe, and for the existence of "dark energy" driving this expansion. The Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) will deliver many hundreds of SNIa detections, and well-sampled g'r'i'z' light curves, over the next 5 years. Using these data, we will obtain a precise measurement of the cosmological parameters (Omega\_mass, Omega\_Lambda); our goal is to determine the cosmological equation of state parameter w to a precision better than +-0.10, and hence test theories for the origin of the universal acceleration. SNLS uses the CFHT MegaCam imager (400 Megapixels, 1 deg{\textasciicircum}2) to image four fields around the sky in 4 filters, with typical time sampling of 3--4 nights. A total of 202 nights of CFHT time has been allocated over the next 5 years for these observations; a large program of followup spectroscopy is now underway at VLT, Gemini, Keck, and Magellan. SNLS has been running since August 2003. There now exist about 330 reliable SN detections with excellent light curves out to beyond redshift 0.9, of which about 80 have been spectroscopically identified as Type Ia's. See http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/SNLS for up-to-the-minute information on the latest SN discoveries.},

The wide field corrector delivers sharp image of 0.25 arc-sec FWHM in r-band over the entire 1.5 degree (in diameter) field of view. The collimation of the camera with respect to the optical axis of the primary mirror is realized by hexapod actuators whose mechanical accuracy is few microns. As a result, we expect to have seeing limited image most of the time. Expected median seeing is 0.67 arc-sec FWHM in i-band. The sensor is a p-ch fully depleted CCD of 200 micron thickness (2048 x 4096 15 μm square pixel) and we employ 116 of them to pave the 50 cm focal plane. Minimum interval between exposures is roughly 30 seconds including reading out arrays, transferring data to the control computer and saving them to the hard drive. HSC uniquely features the combination of large primary mirror, wide field of view, sharp image and high sensitivity especially in red. This enables accurate shape measurement of faint galaxies which is critical for planned weak lensing survey to probe the nature of dark energy. The system is being assembled now and will see the first light in August 2012.},

The Deep layer covers a total of 26 deg2 in four fields, going roughly a magnitude fainter, while the UltraDeep layer goes almost a magnitude fainter still in two pointings of HSC (a total of 3.5 deg2).

	abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thermonuclear exploding stars that can be used to put constraints on the nature of our universe. One challenge with population analyses of SNe Ia is Malmquist bias, where we preferentially observe the brighter SNe due to limitations of our telescopes. If untreated, this bias can propagate through to our posteriors on cosmological parameters. In this paper, we develop a novel technique of using a normalising flow to learn the non-analytical likelihood of observing a SN Ia for a given survey from simulations, that is independent of any cosmological model. The learnt likelihood is then used in a hierarchical Bayesian model with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling to put constraints on different sets of cosmological parameters conditioned on the observed data. We verify this technique on toy model simulations finding excellent agreement with analytically-derived posteriors to within \$1 {\textbackslash}sigma\$.},

	abstract = {We present photometric properties and distance measurements of 252 high redshift Type Ia supernovae (0.15 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.1) discovered during the first three years of the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). These events were detected and their multi-colour light curves measured using the MegaPrime/MegaCam instrument at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), by repeatedly imaging four one-square degree fields in four bands. Follow-up spectroscopy was performed at the VLT, Gemini and Keck telescopes to confirm the nature of the supernovae and to measure their redshifts. Systematic uncertainties arising from light curve modeling are studied, making use of two techniques to derive the peak magnitude, shape and colour of the supernovae, and taking advantage of a precise calibration of the SNLS fields. A flat LambdaCDM cosmological fit to 231 SNLS high redshift Type Ia supernovae alone gives Omega\_M = 0.211 +/- 0.034(stat) +/- 0.069(sys). The dominant systematic uncertainty comes from uncertainties in the photometric calibration. Systematic uncertainties from light curve fitters come next with a total contribution of +/- 0.026 on Omega\_M. No clear evidence is found for a possible evolution of the slope (beta) of the colour-luminosity relation with redshift.},

These data are consistent with the six-parameter inflationary LCDM cosmology. From the Planck temperature and lensing data, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0= (67.8 +/- 0.9) km/s/Mpc, a matter density parameter Omega\_m = 0.308 +/- 0.012 and a scalar spectral index with n\_s = 0.968 +/- 0.006.

Combined with Planck temperature and lensing data, Planck LFI polarization measurements lead to a reionization optical depth of tau = 0.066 +/- 0.016. Combining Planck with other astrophysical data we find N\_ eff = 3.15 +/- 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and the sum of neutrino masses is constrained to {\textless} 0.23 eV. Spatial curvature is found to be {\textbar}Omega\_K{\textbar} {\textless} 0.005. For LCDM we find a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r {\textless}0.11 consistent with the B-mode constraints from an analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP data leads to a tighter constraint of r {\textless} 0.09. We find no evidence for isocurvature perturbations or cosmic defects. The equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 +/- 0.045. Standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the Planck LCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We investigate annihilating dark matter and deviations from standard recombination, finding no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base LCDM are in agreement with BAO data and with the JLA SNe sample. However the amplitude of the fluctuations is found to be higher than inferred from rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. Apart from these tensions, the base LCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

Our combined galaxy sample comprises 1.2 million massive galaxies over an effective area of 9329 deg2 and volume of 18.7 Gpc3, divided into three partially overlapping redshift slices centred at effective redshifts 0.38, 0.51 and 0.61. We measure the angular diameter distance DM and Hubble parameter H from the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) method, in combination with a cosmic microwave background prior on the sound horizon scale, after applying reconstruction to reduce non-linear effects on the BAO feature. Using the anisotropic clustering of the pre-reconstruction density field, we measure the product DMH from the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and the growth of structure, quantified by fσ8(z), from redshift-space distortions (RSD). We combine individual measurements presented in seven companion papers into a set of consensus values and likelihoods, obtaining constraints that are tighter and more robust than those from any one method; in particular, the AP measurement from sub-BAO scales sharpens constraints from post-reconstruction BAOs by breaking degeneracy between DM and H. Combined with Planck 2016 cosmic microwave background measurements, our distance scale measurements simultaneously imply curvature ΩK = 0.0003 ± 0.0026 and a dark energy equation-of-state parameter w = -1.01 ± 0.06, in strong affirmation of the spatially flat cold dark matter (CDM) model with a cosmological constant (ΛCDM). Our RSD measurements of fσ8, at 6 per cent precision, are similarly consistent with this model. When combined with supernova Ia data, we find H0 = 67.3 ± 1.0 km s-1 Mpc-1 even for our most general dark energy model, in tension with some direct measurements. Adding extra relativistic species as a degree of freedom loosens the constraint only slightly, to H0 = 67.8 ± 1.2 km s-1 Mpc-1. Assuming flat ΛCDM, we find Ωm = 0.310 ± 0.005 and H0 = 67.6 ± 0.5 km s-1 Mpc-1, and we find a 95 per cent upper limit of 0.16 eV c-2 on the neutrino mass sum.},

These experiments, composed of data from SDSS, SDSS-II, BOSS, and eBOSS, offer independent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements of angular-diameter distances and Hubble distances relative to the sound horizon, \$r\_d\$, from eight different samples and six measurements of the growth rate parameter, \$f{\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$, from redshift-space distortions (RSD). This composite sample is the most constraining of its kind and allows us to perform a comprehensive assessment of the cosmological model after two decades of dedicated spectroscopic observation. We show that the BAO data alone are able to rule out dark-energy-free models at more than eight standard deviations in an extension to the flat, \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model that allows for curvature. When combined with Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements of temperature and polarization the BAO data provide nearly an order of magnitude improvement on curvature constraints. The RSD measurements indicate a growth rate that is consistent with predictions from Planck primary data and with General Relativity. When combining the results of SDSS BAO and RSD with external data, all multiple-parameter extensions remain consistent with a \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model. Regardless of cosmological model, the precision on \${\textbackslash}Omega\_{\textbackslash}Lambda\$, \$H\_0\$, and \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$, remains at roughly 1{\textbackslash}\%, showing changes of less than 0.6{\textbackslash}\% in the central values between models. The inverse distance ladder measurement under a o\$w\_0w\_a\$CDM yields \$H\_0= 68.20 {\textbackslash}pm 0.81 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm km{\textbackslash}, s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, remaining in tension with several direct determination methods.

	abstract = {We present observations of 10 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) between 0.16 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.62. With previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the Hubble constant (H\_0), the mass density (Omega\_M), the cosmological constant (Omega\_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q\_0), and the dynamical age of the Universe (t\_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10\% to 15\% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega\_M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q\_0 {\textless} 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega\_M {\textgreater} 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q\_0 {\textless}0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega\_M=0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega\_Lambda{\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior (Omega\_M+Omega\_Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater}0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega\_M=1) is ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects reconciles the data with Omega\_Lambda=0 and q\_0 {\textgreater} 0.},

We find consistent cosmological parameter constraints between DES Y3 and KiDS-1000 which, when combined in a joint-survey analysis, constrain the parameter \$S\_8 = {\textbackslash}sigma\_8 {\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\}/0.3\}\$ with a mean value of \$0.790{\textasciicircum}\{+0.018\}\_\{-0.014\}\$. The mean marginal is lower than the maximum a posteriori estimate, \$S\_8=0.801\$, owing to skewness in the marginal distribution and projection effects in the multi-dimensional parameter space. Our results are consistent with \$S\_8\$ constraints from observations of the cosmic microwave background by Planck, with agreement at the \$1.7{\textbackslash}sigma\$ level. We use a Hybrid analysis pipeline, defined from a mock survey study quantifying the impact of the different analysis choices originally adopted by each survey team. We review intrinsic alignment models, baryon feedback mitigation strategies, priors, samplers and models of the non-linear matter power spectrum.},

	abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the CMB anisotropies. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_c h{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.120{\textbackslash}pm 0.001\$, baryon density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_b h{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.0224{\textbackslash}pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965{\textbackslash}pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \${\textbackslash}tau = 0.054{\textbackslash}pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ precision, with \$100{\textbackslash}theta\_*=1.0411{\textbackslash}pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4{\textbackslash}pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m = 0.315{\textbackslash}pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8 = 0.811{\textbackslash}pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\} = 2.99{\textbackslash}pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \${\textbackslash}sum m\_{\textbackslash}nu{\textless} 0.12\$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM at over \$2{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.

	abstract = {In this work we use Lagrangian perturbation theory to analyze the harmonic space galaxy clustering signal of Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) and Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) targeted by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), combined with the galaxy--galaxy lensing signal measured around these galaxies using Dark Energy Survey Year 3 source galaxies. The BGS and LRG galaxies are extremely well characterized by DESI spectroscopy and, as a result, lens galaxy redshift uncertainty and photometric systematics contribute negligibly to the error budget of our ``\$2{\textbackslash}times2\$-point'' analysis. On the modeling side, this work represents the first application of the {\textbackslash}texttt\{spinosaurus\} code, implementing an effective field theory model for galaxy intrinsic alignments, and we additionally introduce a new scheme ({\textbackslash}texttt\{MAIAR\}) for marginalizing over the large uncertainties in the redshift evolution of the intrinsic alignment signal. Furthermore, this is the first application of a hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) model for galaxy bias based on the \${\textbackslash}texttt\{Aemulus\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}nu\$ simulations. Our main result is a measurement of the amplitude of the lensing signal, \$S\_8={\textbackslash}sigma\_8 {\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}Omega\_m/0.3{\textbackslash}right){\textasciicircum}\{0.5\} = 0.850{\textasciicircum}\{+0.042\}\_\{-0.050\}\$, consistent with values of this parameter derived from the primary CMB. This constraint is artificially improved by a factor of \$51{\textbackslash}\%\$ if we assume a more standard, but restrictive parameterization for the redshift evolution and sample dependence of the intrinsic alignment signal, and \$63{\textbackslash}\%\$ if we additionally assume the nonlinear alignment model. We show that when fixing the cosmological model to the best-fit values from Planck PR4 there is \${\textgreater} 5 {\textbackslash}sigma\$ evidence for a deviation of the evolution of the intrinsic alignment signal from the functional form that is usually assumed in cosmic shear and galaxy--galaxy lensing studies.},

	abstract = {In the era of precision cosmology, ensuring the integrity of data analysis through blinding techniques is paramount -- a challenge particularly relevant for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). DESI represents a monumental effort to map the cosmic web, with the goal to measure the redshifts of tens of millions of galaxies and quasars. Given the data volume and the impact of the findings, the potential for confirmation bias poses a significant challenge. To address this, we implement and validate a comprehensive blind analysis strategy for DESI Data Release 1 (DR1), tailored to the specific observables DESI is most sensitive to: Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Redshift-Space Distortion (RSD) and primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG). We carry out the blinding at the catalog level, implementing shifts in the redshifts of the observed galaxies to blind for BAO and RSD signals and weights to blind for PNG through a scale-dependent bias. We validate the blinding technique on mocks, as well as on data by applying a second blinding layer to perform a battery of sanity checks. We find that the blinding strategy alters the data vector in a controlled way such that the BAO and RSD analysis choices do not need any modification before and after unblinding. The successful validation of the blinding strategy paves the way for the unblinded DESI DR1 analysis, alongside future blind analyses with DESI and other surveys.},

These include all suitable SNe Ia in the last 40 years at z{\textless}0.01, measured with {\textgreater}1000 orbits, more than doubling the sample whose size limits the precision of H0. The Cepheids are calibrated geometrically from Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, masers in N4258 (here tripling that Cepheid sample), and DEBs in the LMC. The Cepheids were measured with the same WFC3 instrument and filters (F555W, F814W, F160W) to negate zeropoint errors. We present multiple verifications of Cepheid photometry and tests of background determinations that show measurements are accurate in the presence of crowding. The SNe calibrate the mag-z relation from the new Pantheon+ compilation, accounting here for covariance between all SN data, with host properties and SN surveys matched to negate differences. We decrease the uncertainty in H0 to 1 km/s/Mpc with systematics. We present a comprehensive set of {\textasciitilde}70 analysis variants to explore the sensitivity of H0 to selections of anchors, SN surveys, z range, variations in the analysis of dust, metallicity, form of the P-L relation, SN color, flows, sample bifurcations, and simultaneous measurement of H(z). Our baseline result from the Cepheid-SN sample is H0=73.04+-1.04 km/s/Mpc, which includes systematics and lies near the median of all analysis variants. We demonstrate consistency with measures from HST of the TRGB between SN hosts and NGC 4258 with Cepheids and together these yield 72.53+-0.99. Including high-z SN Ia we find H0=73.30+-1.04 with q0=-0.51+-0.024. We find a 5-sigma difference with H0 predicted by Planck+LCDM, with no indication this arises from measurement errors or analysis variations considered to date. The source of this now long-standing discrepancy between direct and cosmological routes to determining the Hubble constant remains unknown.},

	abstract = {We present cosmological results from the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in galaxy, quasar and Lyman-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ forest tracers from the first year of observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), to be released in the DESI Data Release 1. DESI BAO provide robust measurements of the transverse comoving distance and Hubble rate, or their combination, relative to the sound horizon, in seven redshift bins from over 6 million extragalactic objects in the redshift range \$0.1{\textless}z{\textless}4.2\$. DESI BAO data alone are consistent with the standard flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmological model with a matter density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}=0.295{\textbackslash}pm 0.015\$. Paired with a BBN prior and the robustly measured acoustic angular scale from the CMB, DESI requires \$H\_0=(68.52{\textbackslash}pm0.62)\$ km/s/Mpc. In conjunction with CMB anisotropies from Planck and CMB lensing data from Planck and ACT, we find \${\textbackslash}Omega\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}=0.307{\textbackslash}pm 0.005\$ and \$H\_0=(67.97{\textbackslash}pm0.38)\$ km/s/Mpc. Extending the baseline model with a constant dark energy equation of state parameter \$w\$, DESI BAO alone require \$w=-0.99{\textasciicircum}\{+0.15\}\_\{-0.13\}\$. In models with a time-varying dark energy equation of state parametrized by \$w\_0\$ and \$w\_a\$, combinations of DESI with CMB or with SN{\textasciitilde}Ia individually prefer \$w\_0{\textgreater}-1\$ and \$w\_a{\textless}0\$. This preference is 2.6\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ for the DESI+CMB combination, and persists or grows when SN{\textasciitilde}Ia are added in, giving results discrepant with the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model at the \$2.5{\textbackslash}sigma\$, \$3.5{\textbackslash}sigma\$ or \$3.9{\textbackslash}sigma\$ levels for the addition of Pantheon+, Union3, or DES-SN5YR datasets respectively. For the flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model with the sum of neutrino mass \${\textbackslash}sum m\_{\textbackslash}nu\$ free, combining the DESI and CMB data yields an upper limit \${\textbackslash}sum m\_{\textbackslash}nu {\textless} 0.072\$ \$(0.113)\$ eV at 95\% confidence for a \${\textbackslash}sum m\_{\textbackslash}nu{\textgreater}0\$ \$({\textbackslash}sum m\_{\textbackslash}nu{\textgreater}0.059)\$ eV prior. These neutrino-mass constraints are substantially relaxed in models beyond \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM. [Abridged.]},

	abstract = {We present the DESI 2024 galaxy and quasar baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements using over 5.7 million unique galaxy and quasar redshifts in the range 0.1{\textless}z{\textless}2.1. Divided by tracer type, we utilize 300,017 galaxies from the magnitude-limited Bright Galaxy Survey with 0.1{\textless}z{\textless}0.4, 2,138,600 Luminous Red Galaxies with 0.4{\textless}z{\textless}1.1, 2,432,022 Emission Line Galaxies with 0.8{\textless}z{\textless}1.6, and 856,652 quasars with 0.8{\textless}z{\textless}2.1, over a {\textasciitilde}7,500 square degree footprint. The analysis was blinded at the catalog-level to avoid confirmation bias. All fiducial choices of the BAO fitting and reconstruction methodology, as well as the size of the systematic errors, were determined on the basis of the tests with mock catalogs and the blinded data catalogs. We present several improvements to the BAO analysis pipeline, including enhancing the BAO fitting and reconstruction methods in a more physically-motivated direction, and also present results using combinations of tracers. We present a re-analysis of SDSS BOSS and eBOSS results applying the improved DESI methodology and find scatter consistent with the level of the quoted SDSS theoretical systematic uncertainties. With the total effective survey volume of {\textasciitilde} 18 Gpc\${\textasciicircum}3\$, the combined precision of the BAO measurements across the six different redshift bins is {\textasciitilde}0.52\%, marking a 1.2-fold improvement over the previous state-of-the-art results using only first-year data. We detect the BAO in all of these six redshift bins. The highest significance of BAO detection is \$9.1{\textbackslash}sigma\$ at the effective redshift of 0.93, with a constraint of 0.86\% placed on the BAO scale. We find our measurements are systematically larger than the prediction of Planck-2018 LCDM model at z{\textless}0.8. We translate the results into transverse comoving distance and radial Hubble distance measurements, which are used to constrain cosmological models in our companion paper [abridged].},
